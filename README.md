<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<h2>Day 1</h2>

**1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words.**
	Blockchain is a decentralized database that is stored simultaneously on multiple computers connected to each other on the Internet.

**2. Explain what a Smart Contract is.**
	A smart contract is a computer program that tracks and enforces obligations. Smart contracts codes are executed in the Blockchain.
	
**3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.**
	A transaction is a blockchain storage operation that transfers cryptoassets or other information between wallets. The transaction may charge a fee depending on which blockchain you are on. 
	The script is used to browse the data in the blockhain, it does not change it. And unlike a transaction, it doesn't charge any fees because it costs nothing.

<h2>Day 2</h2>

**1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?**
1. **_Safety and Security:_** Safety is the underlying reliability of any smart contract. Security is the prevention of attacks on the network or smart contracts. Safety and security are critical in smart contracts because of the immutable nature of blockchains, and because they often deal with high-value assets.
2.  **_Clarity:_** Code needs to be easy to read, and its meaning should be as unambiguous as possible. It should also be suited for verification so that tooling can help with ensuring safety and security guarantees. 
3. **_Approachability:_** Writing code and creating programs should be as approachable as possible. Practical tooling, documentation, and examples enable developers to start creating programs quickly and effectively.
4. **_Developer Experience:_** The developer should be supported throughout the entire development lifecycle, from initial application logic to on-chain bugfixes.
5. **_Intuiting Ownership with Resources:_** Resources are a composite data type, similar to a struct, that expresses direct ownership of assets. Cadence’s resources directly tie an asset’s ownership to the account that owns it by saving the resource in the account’s storage.

**2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful?**
These 5 pillars allow even more developers to create secure, easy-to-read and accessible smart contracts. In this way, developers themselves will create this ecosystem.
